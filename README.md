# JS Algorithms XeroCross

This is a collection of classic algorithms implemented in JavaScript.  There's
nothing special or unusual here except perhaps that the author has tried to write the source
files very verbosely so they are easy to read for understanding.

The purpose of this is mainly for the author's own practice, but the source files
may also be of educational use.

## Deployment

You can include the stand-alone script file `jsalgorithms-xerocross.js` directly in
your HTML file.  This exposes a global called `xA` that contains all of the algorithms
supported.

## The Algorithms


### insertionSort

`insertionSort(someArray, compareFunction)` returns a new sorted array.
It does not mutate.

### bubbleSort

`bubbleSort(someArray, compareFunction)` returns a new sorted array.
It does not mutate.

### mergesort

`mergesort(someArray, compareFunction)` returns a new sorted array.
It does not mutate.
